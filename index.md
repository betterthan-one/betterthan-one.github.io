#Two heads are better than one

Too often nonprofits work with too little resources to hire more than one person for a technical competency. The result is that most of their work will never be seen by someone else who might understand what they are creating and offer support and feedback on their work. This robs us of a chance to improve and better serve the communities we work with.

#Come together, right now (or at a scheduled event later)

To help remedy that, Better Than One is a meetup specifically intended to offer an unthreatening environment where you can bring whatever technical projects you are working on and get support and feedback from others in a similar position. During the meetup you are paired with another person matched for area of interest, and you each have half of the time to talk through any projects and details you would like support on. Then, you will take a turn offering the same support.
