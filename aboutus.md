## Who We Are

We are a small group of tech professionals who serve in nonprofits.

## Why We Gather

> If you want to go fast, go by alone; if you want to go far, go together.

Too often a nonprofit misses out on big opportunities to make the most of available technology because the technical staff is just stretched too thin. We can support each other and offer insight since no one can be an expert at everything!
