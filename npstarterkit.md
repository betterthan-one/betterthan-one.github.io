# Get your org online

Technology is just another tool your organization can use to have the impact you're aiming for. There are many great (free) resources out there, and if you are a registered 501c3, there are even more!

## Domain Name

The first step to bringing your org online is to get a domain name (e.g. google.com, jstart.org). There are many different domain registrars, but few offer a particular discount for nonprofits. You should never pay more than $20 for a domain name, and the terms should be yearly.

## Communication: Google G-Suite

Google offers its email, calendar, and document platform [G-Suite](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/index.html) for free to registered nonprofits, complete with using your custom domain to add professionalism and value to your organization.

## Database: Salesforce (10 licenses)

[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.org/nonprofit/) is a constituent relationship manager. It offers a flexible platform to track information about volunteers, donors, program details, and anything else you may need.

If you are a registered nonprofit Salesforce will give you 10 user licenses for free, and a discount on users over that.

## Content Management: WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is a free and open-source content management system with many options for plugins and themes. You can use it to publish photo galleries, blog posts, host donation forms, and even create forums and community conversations.

The WordPress software is free, but hosting it so the public can access it can cost money. You can get a free hosting account with [DreamHost](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215769478-Non-profit-discount) as a way to start, but be ready to move to a more powerful hosting plan as your site grows.
